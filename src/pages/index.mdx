Gwei.cz is a collective of builders from various crypto, decentralization and peer-to-peer communities in and around Czechia. The group assembled in 2020 as online community focused on Ethereum and has been active since.

Our goal is to bring active builders together to support each other and coordinate how to drive local adoption, educate newcomers, and raise awareness of the benefits of decentralized technologies and open-source software.

## FAQ

### What guarantees the neutrality of Gwei.cz?

The current Gwei.cz is just a loosely-coupled group of many different individuals (and their projects), united only by a common interest in improving adoption and awareness of cryptocurrencies, decentralization or open-source projects in the local environment. Gwei.cz has no governance (no leadership) or "official" communication channels and all members are equal.
