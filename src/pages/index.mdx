Gwei.cz is an agnostic collective of individuals from various crypto, decentralization and peer-to-peer communities in and around Czechia. The group assembled in 2020 as online community focused on Ethereum and has been active since.

Our goal is to bring active builders together to support each other and coordinate how to drive local adoption, educate newcomers, and raise awareness of the benefits of decentralized technologies and open-source software.

## FAQ

### What guarantees the neutrality of Gwei.cz?

The current Gwei.cz is just a loosely-coupled group of many different individuals (and their projects) where neutrality is guaranteed mainly through our basic rules, such as zero governance or the absence of official channels.

### What happened with the old Gwei.cz?

All previous internal Gwei.cz activities such as Twitter, Matrix, Forum and [other services](https://status.gwei.cz/) are being gradually phased out as [Gwei.cz Legacy](https://legacy.gwei.cz).
